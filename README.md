LazyScout
=========
By using LazyScout you can find all of the alliance members and opponents you will have over the course of a 
FRC regional, and when they will be playing matches.  The allows you to focus on scouting teams you will be playing
with.

Start by copying the match listings to a .csv file, this is easiest doen using excel or similar, which will format
things in a convenient way.  You can save this file to csv (call it Regional.csv).

In LazyScout.py, you can define the team you are interested in watching by team number, and then run the script.

Two .csv files will be generated.  

The first, Teams.csv, is a list of all the teams you will be alliance members with and opponents you will have

The second, MatchesToWatch.csv, will output a list of every time one of these teams plays.

Now you can be a LazyScout and only watch the relevant teams.
